You've been around this rarlv settling

to do things genteelly. As long as peo

you get ready, they're in no hum ;&lt;_&gt; be

doubtful circumstance*, who have to p;:\
on the spot. If it wasn't convenient tor

one will givo a just explanation of the
system. A g aded sehuul cannot be
taught by a single teacher. It cannot
be kept in a single room. In a graded
school scholars of unequal attainments
are u&lt; f taught by tli? same teacher.—
Graded schools are the cheapest that can
WT! W7*-" T i V'TL- ?5.. ?J2Jj£t". r " -W*. T
be established in large towns where there'
are man) schools.
A graded school is simply a well class
ific 1 School, it is 01.e, in which scholars
of nearly equal attainments occupy the
same room and are taught by the same
instructor. The lowest graded school
must have.two rooms arid two tcacheis.
In this case the more advanced scholars
occupy one room, the less advanced an
Diher. '1 i'C advantage of the system is
that the classes are fewer and large, an J
can have longer time fir recitations. —
Graded seiu v &gt; are commonly divided in
to three departments the Primary, Inter
mediate and Higher. There is a room
and a teacher for each department, and
in large schools two or more to each de
partment. An impartial board of exam
iners assign each pupil to his piupei do
partiuent, and promotes from one loom
to a higher only when a scholar lias pass
ed a thorough examination. Scholars
are received and promoted only at the
1 beginning of the term or year. I said
graded schools are the cheapest where
ever they can-be cstablislu d. Suppose
a township with 0 schools averaging 30
scholuis each could build a In use with
two rooms, and locate it in a place ac
cessible by all the scholars in the town
I do not fav rucii a situation could be
found, but unless the system offers nearly
equal advantages, it had not better be
introduced. Let the directors engage
i two qualified teachers, one for each de
partment. It seems from "KY account
they can be had lot 81.) pet month. In
i graded school a teacher can teach 4b
i scholars easier than 30 in an ungraded
one. Let the directors announce thai
they will examine all the scholars in the
town and admit the best 90 to this new
school. Let it also be understood the
utlier scholars would be admitted as soon
as their own proficiency and the vacan
cies in the High School wculd permit.
This would be a strong incentive to eve
ry child in the towu. After taking out
90 scholars, there would to only 180 left
robe provided fur in tire common schools.
These 180 are never or the same rank
the 270 at first were, and the size of each
.-choul might bQ&lt; slightly increased and,
(ill the scholars have better opportuni
ties han bcf. re 11*36 are assigned to
leach school there will be but five common
schools now. Thus by the graded sys
tem we dispense with 4 out of 9 —almost
half of the common school teachers, and
in their place employ two qualified in
structors. The 836 per month paid to
i these two, is less than was ibrmeily paid;
to the other four. 1 said graded schools
cannot be successfully introduced lie:e
at present ; the population is too scat
tercd, too sparge. We want more com
mon schools as a basis. Every common
school iu the county, inav be graded just
;,s much as any select school with only
one teacher ; because they all can be a&gt;
we'd classified ; but no select school, no
.-eliool receiving all the.sclunar-s who ap
ply. can properly be termed graded, since
i none can have an iinpaitial b)ard of ex

Compromising \\ itii Treason.

Hut presently prevent the ways to wail.

Gives, in your weakness, strength unto your
foe,
And so \our follies fight against yourself.

—licnry I V.. Act I, Scene 3
Tho above extract from Shakespeare
arc much to the point of tie present
times. The compromise mania which
seen s to prevail in certain circles at
Washington and elsewhere, loads every-
O ' J
body to thinking wrong in regard to the
occasion of it. Interest goes a great way
in making up a man's political character
in such times as are now upon us ; and
those who are laboring to dissolve the
Union are well aware of this fact and are
usittg it. It matters little whether we
"Fear and be slain" or' light and uie" —
death is more certain with the fear than
with the light, in such a case as now ex
ists under this government. I oder the
existing circuit.stances, and attempt to
patch up difficulties will be dying with
fear, and "buying treason." What is a
compromise but the offspringof fearing the
consequences of doing what we claim to
be right ?—"paying death servile breath"?
The North has never yet compromised
with the South, that the latter did not
get all the benefits —yea, even more than
it asked. The South lias one virtue
that we can heartily commend —its pluck
to pres its demands whether right or
wrong. The North, on the contrary, has
exhibited on ail occasions the truth
Shakespeare, that "fears oppresseth
strength." It has ever been the fault
of the North to "indent with fear, when
thev have lost and forfeited themselves."
,T
The fears !ia"e always triumphed while
ihe courage of the South had the advan
tage —gamed "strength from our weak
ness." Whereas, if we had met them in
times past with the same spirit they have
exhibited there would be no occasion for
i compromise now —there would have been
none in 1850. New gauranties to the
South never amount to more than new
: pretexts for future demands.
We believe that a majority of the peo
ple constitute the lrghest tribunal of our
c. unity next to lite Ruler of the Uni
verse, and as such their decision cannot
be set aside by any measures which may
ibi hatched up by Congress or Cabinets
■ Tiieir latest decision is that the Tcrrito
f ries are consecrated to Freedom ; there
fore, we believe that any compromise
which surrender."# that principle is a mere
. attempt oi an inferior tribunal to sot
. aside the verdict of a higher, at.d con
trary to the principles and spirit of the
i Constitution,
j Rut. is infinitely more degrading to
. the spirit of the Constitution, as now, to
ibe asked to compromise with treason. —
This is a humiliation against which the
North ought to be clothed in an impen
etrable mail of patriotism. There is nei
: ther reason or palliation for such concil
iation; there can be no pretext for sucb
' humiliation. It is "buying treason" only
to give it new strength, uew insolence.
1 . It is "emptying our coffers" of self re
spect and principle, to buy off unseemly
' ! fears and ungodly treason We say awn v
s I .
with all compromises that look to the
' disarmmeut of free-labor and the streogth
' eniug oI human bondage,—now and for-
lever; for if now it will be forever.
I™ We are indebted to our friend
Cowan, member of Assembly from War
ten, fur a copy of his speech of the 17th
U inst., against the repeal of the Personal
; Liberty law. The speech is brief, but it
t is to the point and just such as we might
r j expect frcui Cowan. We extract the con
I elusion :
, lam further opposed to repeal, because
iit can now do no good. Had they come
j to us in an official way, befoic their overt
r acts ot and asked the.se things,
" even as a right, not a condition of obedi
* unco to the law, they might have been
: granted without a sacrifice of honor, duly
. and sell respect, llut their position is
taken. With a delibeiate purpose they
have done ail i/try can to sunder the
V bonds which bind us together. If this
Urash step shall had to civil war, upou
'those be the responsibility of the frttri
'cidnl act who first raised the standard of
! rebellion against the Government, and
out the l uion" in perii. liy ail meuii&gt;
i the question should he settled note, audi
forever. If our boasted Government is a
; failure, and powerless in the factional
storm, (which I do rot believe if it is
properly administered.) it is high time
we Knew it We have no light to patch
up a truce which is no peace, and trans
mit this red legacy to those who come af
ter lf it is a Government, vital with
the powers of its own perpetuation, let us,
know that also, and have its laws execu
ted to pteserve the Constitution and the
1 Union as ihev wore made by the fathers.
INo compromise or concession of repeal
can satisfy the slave power —the real
cau e of all our trouble —except a com
plete ami abject surrender of tie He pub
lican creed, and a recognition of the right
uf slavery to go into the territories at will,
jaud to be protected there. r l his is really
I their ultimatum. If Republicans arc
heady to grant this, then let them com-
I mencc by voting for repeal. lam not
prepared for such a step yet, nor am 1
I ready to sanction that kind of a comprom
ise which sitnplv means surrender —stand
and deliver I Having exercised the right
;of thinking and voting as we pleased,
and having elected a President in a con
stitutional way, L certainly object to the
demands of the seceders and their back
ers, that we shall now tie his legs so they
can handle him ! ,
j It has been said that the Southerners
admire pluck. I believe they rtspect it
aho. Hence I bJ.icve that a rir.ii, united
and determined North, will do more to
preserve the Union than all the concess
ions which can be extorted from our self
; interest or our fears. We have conceded
; too much already. We conceded the re
■ peal of the M.ssouii Compromise line,
, and we are now reaping tne bitter fruits
of that rash, wrong step. Let them re
store that line—not ask it of us. Let
tl.ose rebuild the temple who de.-troyed
it. We cannot reclaim or save the trai
tors bv a repeal which they care nothing
about, and which they will despise us for
making; but we can save our nianh sod
and self-respect. Let us, by all means,
1 do that. Let us "to our own selves be
' true, and it must follow, as the night the
I day, that we cannot then be false to any
man," or section of men.
: THE SOURUKRN POST-OFFICES.- —The
: following letter expresses the spirit
which now animates some of the branches
of the public service :

THE DISUNION SI NATORS —It is re
. tnarkable to observe in the Senate the
, Di-unitui Senators, who have told the;
country so often that before the next ide.-
