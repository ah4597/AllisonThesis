Exposition of One of the Many
Weaknesses of Our Pub
lic Schools.
D. W. Tomlinson. President ox the
Board of Education at Batavia. N. Y.,
rays;
It Is usually conceded that the graded
chool has within itself a tendency to
oscome clogged. The clogs are little
r'nildren and young people who have
'â– ecome confused, bewildered, discour
aged, crushed. Their final and inevi
table disappearance is the principal
>art of the tragedy of the graded
chocl. A second great element in the
graded school tragedy is the break
down of teachers who are overstrained
in the attempt to force along an ob
structed system. Another deplorable
resuit is the injury done to those who
are retarded In their efforts to acquire,
interest once chilled or destroyed is
difficult of resurrection, If even pos
sible.
Those evils are known and conceded;
and their rem'edy is the question now
uppermost In the minds of educators
and philanthropists. Some distinct
efforts have been made to save the in
terest and the_ careers of the brighter
pupils by disengaging them from those
not endowed with equal qulckess of ap
prehepnslon. This move is but parti
ally successful; for where it succeeds
In disengaging Its subjects It does so
at some sacrifice of continuity of edu
cation. On the other hand, it practi
cally worries the greater multitude of
the discouraged; and It does not entire
ly relieve the strain on the teacher.
So far the argument considers only
the disadvantages of education en masse
But on the other hand sound educa
tional philosophy recognizes a great
stimulus and positive benefit In .num
bers; and the problem of the hfibur Is
how to get all those great benefts with
out the well-known destructive concom
itants. So great and apparent is the
necessity of organization, so manifest
are its advantages, there Is practically
no attempt to find relief in disintegra
tion and chaos. It Is postulated that
the graded school must exist; the only
question Is Its relief from every des
tructive strain.
Individual attempts at self-protection
have led to the building up of various
kinds of special schools and to non
education. And now compulsory edu
cation steps In to arrest the latter. The
general and complete relief of the
graded school Is a question that can be
no longer evaded.
At ttat foot of the Hill of Kotleavor,
O Young One, look upward and see
The shine of the prize
That duzzles the eyes
With the gleam of the glory to be.*
Three years ago the board of educa
tion of Batavia, N. Y.. began an ex
periment looking to such complete re
lief. Their success has been such
that they are still carrying It on with
the greatest confidence; and it is at
tracting much attention. They did
not deem it wise or necessary to dis
turb the general framework of the
graded school or its essential plan.
The grades are still as they were, and
there has been no change in the course
of studies Nor did they find it nec
essary to : axe any addition to the ex
pense: cn the contrary .some saving has
been made n reducing the number of
r.cms ' he r experiment consisted
n trying the use of larger grade-rooms,
into which twice the usual number oi
children c: eld be assembled under twr
â€¢eacherr teacher t condu ct all th:
classes and the other to devote all her
time to ministration among the slower
and more backward pup. Is. The ef
fect was instantaneous in removing all
discouragement, in putting work and
confidence into the laggards, in mak
ing them the equals of their brighter
neighbors, In giving an onward move
ment to the grades. In relieving teach
ers of all strain, in ending the after
school drudgery, In ending home work,
in promoting health and happiness In
all connected in any way with the school
and in the most astonishing changes In
statistics. Greater numbers moved for
ward, higher scholarship was attained
and a most remarkable congestion
began to take place In the high school.
And the tendency is far from exhausted
yet, raising the Interesting question as
to what Is to be the final symmetry of
public education. The "peopleâ€™s col
lege" Is ceasing to be a figure of
speech, not that It is trenching on the
college domain, but that It is produc
ing the scholarly spirit that must go
on.
But the special merit of the Batavia
experiment is that It takes all cruelty
out of teaching while at the same time
it makes education a success and de
light. And it does all this without any
cost to teachers. Rather It does all
this and adds to the vigor and vitality
of teachers. They are constantly gain
ing In vitality, spiritual growth and pro
fessional skill and power. It Is no
longer dangerous to attend the graded
school; and It is no longer dangerous
to have children attending the graded
school.
These are among the great conclu
sions that have been Impressed upon
thosp who have been watchfng this In
teresting experiment from its first
Inclplency to the present :time. ,Ahd
It has no drawbacks to report; any
theoretical objections that might be
raised to such a plan are found to be
utterly baseless In the light of Its actual
operation. Those who have been
watching It with the utmost care feel
that an Important milestone has bjen
passed In the history of human rescue,
as well as In the history of theoretical
and practical pedagogy.

If people only knew what we know
about Kodol Dyspepsia Cure it would
be used in nearly every household, as
there are few people who do not suffer
i from a feeling of fullness after eating,
belching, flatulence, sour stomach or
water-brash, caused by indigestion or
: dyspepsia. A preparation, such as Ko
dol Dyspepsia Cure, which, with no
aid from the stomach, will digest your
food, certainly can't help but do you
good. Kinney &. Co.
