live. Swisshelm, of the St. Cloud (Mian.)
Demoerat, has a chapter on dancing, and ie
most decidedly in favor of that kind of
umaiwnietit. Hear how beretically she talkn:
It is worthy of notice that those churches
and people who most strenuously oppose
daneinjr, have always encouraged und prac
ticed it under other names. Like the tern
"peranoe mtiu who oould not drink cider, but
had no objection to a glass of apple juice,
our opponent# of dancing bave their children
taught the art under the name Of "Calisthe
nics," and praetioe it when it ie called
"Plays." For it is a remarkable fact, that
these old time favorites of religious commu
nities, "Dear Sister Pbaeba," "Ring around
Ro«y," "All a marohing to Quebeo," "The
White Cockade," "Copenhagen," Ae., Ao.,
Ao., are, every one of them, cotillions and
contra dances performed to voeal and instru
mental music.
The difference between the religious dance
and the profane dance is, that in the former
ef erv man in the room is oompelled, on pain
of breach of etiquet, to kiss every woman in
the room and vice versa, that it is quite io
order for married women to sit down on the
knees ef young gentlemen, put their anus
aroand their necks, bring two pair of lips
together with a smack and do any amount of
bugging. While, in a profane dance—even
those of most doubtful propriety, the great
est familiarity, between persons of opposite
sexee, is a gentleman placing one hand on
a lady's waist while she rests one hand on
his shoulder and holds his disengaged hand
ID the other. The churches, therefore, who
set up rules against dancing, are all fairly
and squarely oommitted to the doetrine that
promiscuous dancing is all right, and pious
and innocent, provided it is aooompanied by
promiscuous kissing, with a suitable allow
ance of hugging and general rough and tum
ble, while without these refiuing and eleva
ting addition* it is evil on evil, and that oon
tinually. There is no escaping this conclu
sion, for the anti-dancing ohurohes and
Christians are too openly committed in favor
of these vulgar plays for an intelligent man
to deny, that either they have aoted blindly
or that the kissing and bugging eenotifioe the
dancing.
Now, since all the experience of the past
proves that people WILL dance, even grave
and reverend deacons, we are in favor of
the dancing without the etceteras. But apart
from all oomparisone, *e regard daneing as
a positive good, as something which requires
no apology, but is inherently right in itself
an efficient means of perfecting, refining and
cultivating the crowning work of God'* ere
ction a means appointed and directly ap
proved by the Creator himself! it i« liable
lo abuse, and the objeot of reformers should
Oe to regulate, not abolish it.

The motion was last. The Governor thought

that such wastheoase, though inadvertently.

Some intereet is manifested in the proba
ble result ef the oases of contested seats in
tbe Hoase. No definite conclusion can be
arrived at, until the reports of the oommit
toe upon their. Whatever that report may
be, it will be very likely to be sustained by
the House for, 1st, it is a fair and compe
tent committee, and it has all the evidence
before it, wbioh will be fully exAiined and
impartially considered. 2d, the composition
of the oommittce is suoh—tbe chairman be
inga South American—that either the South
Americans and Republioans or South Ameri
cans and Democrats will go together in eup
port of the several recommendations of the
committee. Tho friends of Frank Blair and
Howard of Michigan feel much confidence
that tbe claims of tbeee two gentlemen will
be reooguized. If so, it would facilitate the
sase of Republican evolutions in ths House
amazingly. Any thing deoent and desirable
could be done with two more votes and I
think we shall get one, at least. 1 tbink,
from what I can learn, that Daly, who is
contesting the seat of Estabrook, Delegate
from Nebraska, stands a very fair ohanoe of
procuring tbe seat from that Territory. I
hope so, for 1 think he had a majority of the
lawful votee. We have so gained on them
in Nebraska now that* they can only beat us
by gouging and it would greatly encourage
our friends there if they could see their
wrongs righted here, and some leading Ter
ritorial dignitaries of our own faith and
spirit* __

I think the &amp;ttbces are that tbeT*rftPvrtf!
be improved by this Congress in a manner
essentialljfeto benefit American industry not
by re-modeling the Tariff entirely, and per
haps by raising the aggregate, but by a more
discreet and judioious adjustment of duties
upon a^ew important articles, and the sub
stitution of specific for ad valorem duties in
loading oases. Such I hope may be theeaee.
It would be eaey, without tbe levying of one
dollar more than is now raised, certainly
without the levying of one dollar more than
it will be necessary to raise as long as this
squandering Administration is in power, to
oause thjcountry fairly to jump for the sud
denness ef restored prosperity. Six months
under suoh a Tariff as we might easily have
would almost work a miracle, and render it
diffioult for us to realise that we had been
so lately suffering under Buoh extreme pros
tration.
But-1 am going to flght bo m«N Tariff
battles. 1 have been through several, and I
have eeen, often enough to satisfy my anxie
ty, bow effeotually plausible sophistries and
caleh-words oan be used against tbe most
benefieial adjustment of duties, and bow im
possible it is to establish and maintain by
psrty power a Tariff formed on the principle
of adequate protection. I am fully content
to let the people have all the experience tbey
want uader an ill-adjusted Tariff perfectly
retoived,so far an any effort of mine is con
cerned, that the Tariff issue shall settle ittetj,
fully persuaded that, settled in that manner,
it will be muoh tbe most likely to remain
settled.
It is interesting to see how the foreign
Ministers resident here, dispose of them
selves when they appear on tbe floor of tbe
Senate. Nearly all of them range them
selves around on ths Democratio side. The
simple reason, or the obief one, undoubtedly
if*, beoause it is for tbeir interest and is their
natural inclination to stand well with the
Administration, if the Administration were
other than it is, doubtless tbey would equal
ly favor it, in such ways. The possession
of power is muoh in many aspeots. What
Would the Democratio party be to-day with
out tbe possesion or strong hope of it
Tho British Minister, Lord Lyons, however,
and tbe Charge from Bremen, seem most at
home and are generally found on tbe Re
publican side. Lord Lyons is an unusually
modest and unassuming gentlemen. Tou
will occasionally see bim on the floor of that
body, holding his bat behind his back, and
would be apt to tiike bim for some quiet and
unobtrusive oitizen wbo wae interested in
noticing tbe character of tbe debates and
the manner of doing business in the Ameri
can Senate. But tbe Republican portion of
that body has now beoome too numerous and
powerful to be overlooked or too coolly
treated, by foreign diplomats sr by the home
Administration. Without the eonsent of
Republioane in that body, now, neither

Are you or your readers
aware that we have a Female Seminary in
our midst capable of educating young ladiee
just as thoroughly as any in the oountry,
either East or West? And has it ever en
tered into the oaloulations of our money

that tbe saviqg in expense of suoh an insti
tution located at home is a very great item

would be educated these times, if we did not
happen to have suoh a sohool among us. 1
don't know how tbey will be now, unless that
school is sustained, even at some saorifioe
and retrenchment elsewhere.
The income of the school is not now re
munerative, with bad .debts amounting to
$100 a year, aocruing every term. How
long it will be possible to continue it with
out better support, I do not know. I pre
sume not long, however, sinoe good teaebers
aan obtain a support in other plaoes, if not
here. The loss or suspension of this school
at the present time must be regarded as a
very great public calamity, morally, sooially
and financially.
But as an instanoe of the deep intereet
felt by our citizens in their Seminary, the
Principal informed me that up to last week
it bad not been visited by a single lady of
the soore or more who have daughters
studying there since Sept. |aet whioh proves
either that they are very indifferent to the
progress of their daughters, or that tbey have
such unbounded oonfidenoe in the teaohers
that tbey do not think it worth while even to
see what is going on. There was a good old
deacon onee, wbo went to sleep when he
knew tbe minister, and was sure tbe sermon
would orthodox, but kept wide awake wheo
ever a young man preached whoso doctrinal
soundness he was not so sure of. Suoh a
kind of oonfidenoe may be very complimen
tary, but it ie not desirable. Nor is that
kind of visitation which comes in only at
reviews and public days, and leaves the real,
every-day work of the eehool unnoticed. A
publio examination is a very imperfect test
of tbe real character of a sohool. It is of
ten tiresome to the spectators, and unfair or
unequal to the scholars. And yet it hae be
oome tbe fashion to crowd all tbe visiting
into three days, leaving all the rest of the
term as unnoticed as if there were nothing
going on. Let me assure tbe ladiee of Keo
kuk that an hour or two now and then in
listening to tbe daily recitations of this
sohool, would prove the moet instructive and
entertaining recreation they oould possibly
find, if tbey only knew it, and would take
trouble to etep in. Tbey would learn some
things that were not taught when tbey weat
to school, aod which are taught here in a
very interesting manner. Besidee, both pu
pils and teachers need the stimulus of suoh
visitation. It eonneote tbe exereieee of tbe
school room with real life, and makee them
feel that they are not ieolated from eociety,
but living and baman beings like the rest of
a.
1 stepped in on Tburedey, an boar or two,
io advance of the regular review, whioh oc
curred on Friday, and was really intereeted,
whioh it is not always eaey to say of school
visitations. Two things were plainly ob
servable in regard to the instruction here,
whicb are of very great value: 1st. That the
pupils are taught thoroughly and analytical
ly the subjects whioh they study, so that tbey
know something about them aside from tbe
text beoke, as I discovered by asking them
some freeb questions. 2d. That tbey are
taught practically, i.e., that knowledge is
not mere abstract principles, but associated
with interesting Jacte in praotioal life, aod
belonging to the world we live in. This is
not always ths ease in our high schools and
seminaries. I might also add to these a
third: That tbe knowledge imparted and
methods of teaching are up to the timet, and
keep pace with the eobvtant improvements
and discoveries in science. This 1 dieoover
ed by finding myself quite rusty on some
points on wbioh I supposed I was tolerably
well posted. These recitations io Physical
Geography and Astronomy make one feel
like going to sohool again. Tbe eolar sys
tem has inoreased its family since we knew it,
and geography has been promoted from tbe
lowest form to become the study of the school
room, while Chemistry will soon be grown
quite beyond our reoolleotion if we do not
visit the schools oftener.
The rooms at present oooupied by the
school, under the Methodist Church, are tol
erably comfortable and convenient,—doubt
less tbe most so in tbe city. We need, how
ever, and must have a new building, what
the times get better, that shall oompare with
tbe Medical College.
1 bad intended to say something about the
Calisthenios, or Orthodox Dancing, as it is
sometimee facetiously called, wbieh is a
very pleasant feature of this Seminary, but
mast dsfer It till another oommunioation.

Dbab Gatb :—As a faithful chronicler of
trifles, as well as important events, you saw
fit to publish a small affair from my pen, in
whioh the intimation was very mildly con

ure the literary and editorial ability of a
certain Doctor, who acknowledges the re
sponsibility of the first person plural of the
Plaindealer. 1 am obliged to extend my
opinion and add other deficiencies to my ee
timate of his qualifications. He describes
my pleasant sarcasm on bis achievements as
a politioal editor as a "purely personal" at
tack. I must claim that he is fully as in
competent to solve a question of etiquette as
to wield a pen or eater to the tastes of a hun
gry public. I cannot ooneeot to have any
personal controversy with bim. I have sev
eral reasons for this. In the first plaoe, I
do not wish it. Personally 1 have no objeo~
tion to him. Politically and editorially I es
teem him very small potatoes. It is in this
regard that he plaoes himself before the
public. He hae done this voluntarily. No
one oould have laid an action of damagee
against him if he had seen fit to deoline thie
editorial notoriety. When he, irritated by
only a bantering sarcasm, vents himself in
