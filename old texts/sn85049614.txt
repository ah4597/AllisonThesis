Tfte reason for taUaf so anatt a Mn
ber a( places for this comparuoa ia Utat
so many o/ the towns and aities bare no
private schools with which to compare
public acboola are doing the whale work
of instruction. The cause of the wide
lifference in the expense af private
aehoole in these places, is the (act that
in some of them only a sitijgle school of
a high grade te sustained, while ia Others
no such school is sustained, aod some
one or two primary schools are kept,
mainly for children too young to be ad
milled to the public schools, and hence
tUe tuition is placed low.
As it is well known that insturction in
a respectable Academy or Female Sem
inary can rarely if ever be obtained for
less than $18,00 pe* year, aixi aa pub
lic school with which a good high school
department is connected, affords advan
tages equivalentto those obtained in sa«b
institutions, it is more Csir te atake the
following comparison. In eight of these
places, namely. Cleveland, Colambus,
Franklin, Fredericktown, Granr ie I e-'!
