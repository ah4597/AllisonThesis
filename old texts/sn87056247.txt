Auclitor's Report--A gain.
In last week's Hepuhlican, the editor de
votes over a column in reply to our article
on the Audit? fs report. "NY havo read
his article on.refu.Hv, and are unable to see
wherein hi throws any new light on ti e
subject, in answer to our strictures. His
donbU as 1o tho ' authorship, amount to
nothing as ho admits. The ex-Auditor
furnished us the figures on which we based
our article. Ve requested him to do this,
from the fact that his knowledge of tho
books would enable him to brinir the items
together with less trouble and greater nc
curacy, and hence his issis;auce to that
extent.
In our article we did not attempt to de
fend the ox-Auditor or any of the reports
which he published; but our object was to
examine the report for thi year, and see
if it was correct. If the Republican failed
to exhibit the errors, if there were any, in
the reports published heretofore, it is no
argument that we should pursue the tame
course now, and permit the people to re
main in ignorance in regard to the true
stnte of our county finances.
We stated that the rail road stock had
been reported as so mucu receipts, and
thai orders a id interest were outstanding to
that amox:n, over and above what seemed
to j2 tho indebtedness of the county. The
Libra: v on!r, which has caused such a
jreni sensation in the Republican camp,
was issued long before the "ex-Auditor"
came lato office; consequently, if it was
not reported, it was no fault of his. Mr.
Dunham, v.-ho was Auditor from 1 C 14 to
1850, statrd in his first exhibit, that the
books hvi been kept in such a manner that!

Auditor. Hut this is irrelevant to the
questions at issue, and wo have it to at
tend to matters directly in point.
The Republican says: "In regard to
the 80 OS for stationery purchased in
IC52 and '53, allowed at the June term,
we think every candid man will justify the
Auditor's course. It of right belongs to ' have no hesitancy in saying that it ii the

tnnrial condition of the countv, and "not
for electioneering purposes." as our Con-
gressman would say. This admission of
the Republican, taken in connection with
ti e whole tenure and bearing of the report,
clearly demonstrates to any unbiased mind
that pariyism dictated it. The plain
truth of tho mf.tter is, that the law requires
the order to bo reported, which were is
sued between the 1st day of June and the
SI st day of May, inclusive, and no others.
This order for stationery will be liable to
be reported next Juae, from the fact that
it Is nrmberd and registered among the
orders which were iaancd since the 31st of
May.
The editor of the Republican does not
claim that the Auditor was right in report
ing the Treasurer's collecting fees as so
rauch xpense, but says that "The Audit
or, however, seems to think that his report
in that particular is correct, and thinks
hJ can satisfy all candid men that it is.
who will take the trouble to investigate the
mattr."
Now, we profess to be candid in regard
to the matter: havo investigated it thor
oughly, and don't think it right in that
particular, or some others that wo have
named. We should like to bear the Au
ditor, tr the editor of the Republican, at
tempt to convince candid men that the
proper method of book-keeping is to
charge for amounts paid out and not give
orfitWi when received, or vice versa. If
this can be sa'isfactorily demonstrated, as
the "Auditor seems to think" U can, it
will obviate necessity of sending oar
young men away from home to gain a
commercial education.-. As we remarked
in our former article, the Treasurer was al
lowed, bylaw, to retain his fees (8681.)
ooi of the whole amount of county, schaol.
school hoase. road aJ sW M
which was apportioned among thero. and
deducted from them, the balance beinjthe
total receipts.
The most superficial observer can see at
glance, that the Auditor will fail to con
viwee business mon that even the 8224 re-
tained for collecting the county revenue,
should not have been charged as an item of
expense, unless that amount had been
added to the receipts.
The 364 reported as bein" paid to the
Treasurer for settling with the State, was
overlooked by the editor in his reply.
Come, Mr. Editor, explain, or get the Au
ditor to, as the "dynasty ' do not wish it
understood that they were in the habit of
paying the Treasurer out of the County
funds for settling with the State. The
county never paid that amount for that
; Y rtuiuuui lau
V e are tll of tho opinion that the Au-
a nor reported me county indebtedness at
least one thousand dollars more than it
reauy is, no matter whether the ex-Audit-
or s reports were right or wrong. The
statement that two individuals are known
to have 2400, would probably admit of a
slight modification. If tbey hold that
amount ot orders at tins time, there is no
0 ..I
deubt but many of them were issued at the
June term. If they held that amount on
the first of June, probably moro than half
of them have been redeemed. It matters
not, so lar as uns controversy is concern-
eu, wncuier mo county indebtedness is
oi.uuo or ??io,ooo; our position is, that
the Auditor has charged items aroountmor
o about one thousand dollars which should
not have been reported. If he can show a
different state of facts, wo should be clad
0 have him do so.

the stationery order, the Treasurer's col

some "friends" who were rooming with
him. That's talk about town, anyhow;
whether it's so or not. The talk is, that

she appropriated to her own use Mra. Gam

her brother, but finally concluded to give
them up. A gentleman down town had a

for "I feel it in my bones." as dad Vin-

diggings I went over last Sunday," after
being invited Saturday night to come, and
as I was going through among the wag
gons, tents, crush shanties, and some few
log cabins covered with spruce pine, brush
and dirt, it was a curiosity to se their dif
ferent occupations the old, with specta
cles, the middle aged and the young wri
ting, and all, I presume, on ditferent busi
ness and subjects some on business of
profit, and others to their loved ones at
home (an article that Enoch has not cot).
Some with tail gates of waggons, and lots

wun gout pans or pine jogs, and every po
sition that could bo thought of for writin
letters. Some cooking for the week to
come, or already come, some singing 'hal
lelujahs.' while others war sinirin 'Bar-

but tho hills made such a halloo!Ã¶ In re

morning some one had a. .rooster that
crowed in tho morn:ng, and' probably a
hundred men tried to beat; the noise caus
ed a mule te bray, and for nearly a mile
in every directior. might be heard the bray
ing of men in imitation, and I am not
ashamed to say that I cojM not tell the
mule fiom the men. Enough on this sub
ject. Hundreds are coming here daily, and are
returning by fifties, swearing that it is all
a humbug, and in some respects it is, for
there are only a ijw who get gold. This
kind of mining is a new thing to many,
and many have not their Isads open, and
sluices ready to work, but are progress
ing very fast. Some forty or fifty men
with saws going steady, tnd principal! all
for sluices. There is hsrdly a housa with
floor O" door, as all othei business monop
oly and speculation arc set aside, and the
digging made the order ot the day.
The finder of a new nine is entitled to
trfo claims, one as discovering claim, and j
the other he will stake off for Tom, Dick,
and Harry, and then ommence selling,
some pay and some do nt. Gregory, the
first discoverer, told nie 'hat he had sold
more than 8100,000 vrorth of claims in
about a month. lie sold his last and best
claim last Monday, for $40,000 the men
opened it and took out &amp;5 to tho pan.
Gregory eays he will giv S10.000 to rue
back again. II sells claims, payments to
be made weekly after th3 buyer can get to
work, or all that is made over expenses,
under forfeiture of the claim. His income
amounted to 81,000 before the last 840,
000. They are allowed fifty by one hun
dred fest for a claim, and probably this is
more than five midd?5Aged men would dig
in their life-time the claims are toolarge,
it don't giv enough i chance to work.
Now for my prospects. I am at Dead
wood diggings, the timber all being killed
for thousands of acrei together; the creek
is called St. Vraiu't fcrk; some call the
diggings Jeffeason diggings, after a town
laid outon the creek, but 'nary' housa in
the town. I am in company with three
others; we hold a claim tt three hundred
feet up and down the crek, we commenc
ed turniag the creek, bu: the snow in sight
of us began to melt and swelled tho creek
to quite a river, and washed away the dams
which were built, and it has kept rising
till a few days past. "VYe turned in the
ground sluices off the tp dirt, thinking
tho crsek would fall sooa, but we were all
disappointed. W hav given up any cer

Private advices from Tuscoa Arizona
to July 2, states that Peschiera had arriv
ed at HermosoIIo, and announced his in
tention of driving all the Apache Indiana
north of the line with the aid of a Sonora
battalion.
The revolt of the Gagui and Apache- In
dians seemed to have teen suppressed;
but another has broken out in tho northern
part of Sonora, and a band of four hundred
men, under a Papago Indian leader, were
doing great damage to property.
It was expected that Lieut. Mowery and
Edward Cross, the Arionian, would tight a

lhe Secretary oi the Interior has. under
the act of March 3, 1859 making appro
priations preliminary to the eight census
appointed Mr. James C. G. Kennedy to
laKrt direction ot the work.
It is n well asertained fact, known to tho
Indian bureau, that very many of the dis
turbances are justly attributable to the en
croachment of the whites on the reserva
tions set apart for Indians by the general
goverr.msnt. The whites having once ob
tained possession, there is no way, th U.
S. military forc6 bein small, to dispossess

their remaining unlawfully on the soil, new

who are thus continually harassed in their
affairs.
Owing to the inadequate number of In
dian agents it has been found impossible
n every case to carry out all tho treaty ob
igation, or in time to impress tho Indians
tavorably by an exhibition of our irood faith
and to proven dissatisfaction arising: from
uniuitiuea pledges.
A letter from Genoa, Juno 26, says:
The organization of the Hungarian Legion
