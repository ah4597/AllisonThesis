of liuchanatiisui, and true National ques

praising the nati-nial interest of Slavery,
und iu denouncing John Letcher, the Im
position ciudidatc, because tho latter some '
years since avowed bis sympathy with the
Anti-Slavery fecliog in Western Virginia.
This disgusted the true conservative Re
publican element in the Slate, which,
though not noisy, is strong ; and thus,
while Goggin gained largely in the slave
holding portion, Letcher gained also among
the freemen, aud is elected. So the Op
pi tili on have lost Virginia, by this base
tiuckliug to the Slave fewer. One or
mure of the Congressmen elected arc nut
